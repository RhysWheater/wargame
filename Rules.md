# My Wargame Rules
*A Minimalist Mass Battle Wargame*

---

## 1. CORE CONCEPT  
1. A fast-playing wargame for massed battles, focusing on unit cohesion and positioning rather than individual model hit points.
1. Designed for quick, decisive games that reward clever positioning and cohesion management.
1. Units degrade via cohesion (not hit points) through combat, morale shocks, and positioning.  
1. Inspired by the tactical depth of BloodBowl's positioning, blocking and dodging mechanics, but applied to massed battles.
1. The system works with any scale or base size, provided both sides use the same base width.
1. All distances are measured in **base widths**.

---

## 2. UNIT STATES  
1. Each unit has four cohesion states:  
   **<span style="color:green">Fresh</span> → <span style="color:goldenrod">Shaken</span> → <span style="color:orange">Disrupted</span> → <span style="color:red">Destroyed</span>**
1. **<span style="color:green">Fresh</span>**: Full combat effectiveness.  
1. **<span style="color:goldenrod">Shaken</span>**: May act but suffers minor penalties.  
1. **<span style="color:orange">Disrupted</span>**: Severely impaired.  
1. **<span style="color:red">Destroyed</span>**: Removed from battlefield.  
1. Units degrade one state when they take a *hit*.  
1. Use tokens, markers, dice, or dials to track unit states.

---

## 3. TURN STRUCTURE  
1. Players alternate **activating one unit at a time** until all units have acted.  
1. Each activated unit may perform one of the following:  
   1. **Move**  
   1. **Attack** (if engaged)  
   1. **Fall Back** (see 8)  
   1. **Rally** (see 9; if Shaken or Disrupted, and not engaged)

---

## 4. MOVEMENT  
1. Units move a standard distance of **1 base width** (unless terrain modifies it).  
1. Units may pivot freely before or after movement.  
1. Units may not move through or end movement inside enemy units.
1. Units may not end movement inside friendly units.
1. Units may not move through friendly units unless they have the **Skirmisher** trait.

---

## 5. SUPPORT  
1. In melee, a unit gains **+1 Resolve** for each **supporting friendly unit**:  
   - **Side support**: Base to base contact on either side, facing the same direction.
   - **Rear support**: Directly behind and not engaged.  

---

## 6. FACING  
1. **Flank attacks** grant +1 Resolve.  
1. **Rear attacks** grant +2 Resolve.  
1. Defending units gain **no support** if attacked from flank or rear.

---

## 7. COMBAT RESOLUTION  
1. **Compare Resolve**: (base + support + modifiers).  
1. **Roll Dice**:  
   - If equal: attacker rolls 1D6 and picks result.  
   - If attacker has higher Resolve: attacker rolls 2D6, picks best.  
   - If defender has higher Resolve: defender rolls 2D6, picks best.  
1. **Combat Result Table:**  

   | Roll | Result       | Effect                                  |  
   | ---- | ------------ | --------------------------------------- |  
   | 1    | Repulsed     | Attacker takes 1 hit                    |  
   | 2    | Brutal Clash | Both attacker and defender take 1 hit  |  
   | 3-4  | Forced Back  | Defender pushed back 1 base width       |  
   | 5    | Hit & Hold   | Defender takes 1 hit                    |  
   | 6    | Breakthrough | Defender takes 1 hit and is pushed back |  

1. Pushbacks must move directly away. If unable (blocked), defender takes 1 hit instead.

---

## 8. FALL BACK (VOLUNTARY WITHDRAWAL)  
1. Declare Fall Back instead of attacking.  
1. Roll D6: **3+ to succeed**.  
1. Modifiers:  
   - −1 per enemy engaged.  
   - −1 if Shaken/Disrupted.  
   - +1 if supported by unengaged friendly unit.  
1. Success: move up to **1 base width** away, facing enemy.  
1. Failure: remain in place and become **Shaken**.

---

## 9. RALLY  
1. Unit must be Shaken or Disrupted and **not engaged**.  
1. Roll D6:  
   - 4+: Recover 1 state (Disrupted → Shaken or Shaken → Fresh).  
   - +1 if within 1 base width of commander or camp.

---

## 10. COMMANDERS (OPTIONAL)  
1. Commanders provide +1 to Rally tests.  
1. May grant one nearby unit an **extra activation** per turn.  
1. If destroyed, all friendly units must pass a Rally test or become Shaken.

---

## 11. VICTORY  
1. Win by:  
   - Destroying/routing a set number of enemy units (e.g., 50%).  
   - Or controlling key objectives at game end.

---

## 12. FUTURE EXPANSIONS  
1. Add scenarios, unit traits, terrain rules, campaigns, etc.  
1. Include skirmishers, cavalry, artillery in later modules.

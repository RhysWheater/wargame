# My Wargame Rules
*A Minimalist Mass Battle Wargame*

---

## 1. CORE CONCEPT  
1.1 A fast-playing wargame for massed battles, focusing on unit cohesion and positioning rather than individual model hit points.
1.2 Units degrade via cohesion (not hit points) through combat, morale shocks, and positioning.  
1.3 Inspired by the tactical depth of BloodBowl's positioning and blocking mechanics, but applied to massed battles.
1.4 The system works with any base size, provided both sides use the same frontage.  
1.5 All distances are measured in **base widths**.

---

## 2. UNIT STATES  
2.1 Each unit has four cohesion states:
**<span style="color:green">Fresh</span> → <span style="color:goldenrod">Shaken</span> → <span style="color:orange">Disrupted</span> → <span style="color:red">Destroyed</span>**
2.2 **Fresh**: Full combat effectiveness.  
2.3 **Shaken**: May act but suffers minor penalties.  
2.4 **Disrupted**: Severely impaired.  
2.5 **Destroyed**: Removed from battlefield.  
2.6 Units degrade one state when they take a *hit*.  
2.7 Use tokens, markers, dice, or dials to track unit states.

---

## 3. TURN STRUCTURE  
3.1 Players alternate **activating one unit at a time** until all units have acted.  
3.2 Each activated unit may perform one of the following:  
3.3 **Move**  
3.4 **Attack** (if engaged)  
3.5 **Fall Back** (see 8)  
3.6 **Rally** (see 9; if Shaken or Disrupted, and not engaged)

---

## 4. MOVEMENT  
4.1 Units move a standard distance of **1 base width** (unless terrain modifies it).  
4.2 Units may pivot freely before or after movement.  
4.3 Units may not move through enemy units.

---

## 5. SUPPORT  
5.1 In melee, a unit gains **+1 Strength** for each **supporting friendly unit**:  
5.2 **Side support**: Adjacent and not engaged.  
5.3 **Rear support**: Directly behind and not engaged.  
5.4 Maximum of **+2 support** may be counted.

---

## 6. FACING  
6.1 **Flank attacks** grant +1 Strength.  
6.2 **Rear attacks** grant +2 Strength.  
6.3 Defending units gain **no support** if attacked from flank or rear.

---

## 7. COMBAT RESOLUTION  
7.1 **Compare Strengths**: (base + support + modifiers).  
7.2 **Roll Dice**:  
7.3 If equal: attacker rolls 1D6 and picks result.  
7.4 If attacker stronger: attacker rolls 2D6, picks best.  
7.5 If defender stronger: defender rolls 2D6, picks best.  
7.6 **Combat Result Table:**  

| Roll | Result       | Effect                                  |  
| ---- | ------------ | --------------------------------------- |  
| 1    | Repulsed     | Attacker takes 1 hit                    |  
| 2    | Brutal Clash | Both attacker and defender take 1 hit  |  
| 3-4  | Forced Back  | Defender pushed back 1 base width       |  
| 5    | Hit & Hold   | Defender takes 1 hit                    |  
| 6    | Breakthrough | Defender takes 1 hit and is pushed back |  

7.7 Pushbacks must move directly away. If unable (blocked), defender takes 1 hit instead.

---

## 8. FALL BACK (VOLUNTARY WITHDRAWAL)  
8.1 Declare Fall Back instead of attacking.  
8.2 Roll D6: **3+ to succeed**.  
8.3 Modifiers:  
8.4 −1 per enemy engaged.  
8.5 −1 if Shaken/Disrupted.  
8.6 +1 if supported by unengaged friendly unit.  
8.7 Success: move up to **1 base width** away, facing enemy.  
8.8 Failure: remain in place and become **Shaken**.

---

## 9. RALLY  
9.1 Unit must be Shaken or Disrupted and **not engaged**.  
9.2 Roll D6:  
9.3 4+: Recover 1 state (Disrupted → Shaken or Shaken → Fresh).  
9.4 +1 if within 1 base width of commander or camp.

---

## 10. COMMANDERS (OPTIONAL)  
10.1 Commanders provide +1 to Rally tests.  
10.2 May grant one nearby unit an **extra activation** per turn.  
10.3 If destroyed, all friendly units must pass a Rally test or become Shaken.

---

## 11. VICTORY  
11.1 Win by:  
11.2 Destroying/routing a set number of enemy units (e.g., 50%).  
11.3 Or controlling key objectives at game end.

---

## 12. FUTURE EXPANSIONS  
12.1 Add scenarios, unit traits, terrain rules, campaigns, etc.  
12.2 Include skirmishers, cavalry, artillery in later modules.

---

**IRON PUSH** is designed for quick, decisive games that reward clever positioning and cohesion management.
